runmeter2gpx
================

Export workouts from [Runmeter](https://abvio.com/runmeter/) database to gpx.


## Usage

1. Put your `Meter.db` that was extracted from Runmeter into the same folder as `index.py`
2. run the command `python index.py`
3. wait and you will see your `.gpx` files being created.

You should see your files being populated in the same folder as the program.

## Why

Due to the [complete](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gps-problems-iphone-7-or-ios10.1998933/) [failure](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7691462?start=0&tstart=0) of Apple and the GPS on the iPhone 7 Plus, I needed a way to extract the files and bulk upload the rest to Garmin Connect and Strava. This program is loosely based on [runmeter2geojson](https://github.com/igorti/runmeter2geojson).
